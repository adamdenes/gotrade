### TODOs
* use ema200 to determine up/down trends
* only trade with the trend -> above ema200 line uptrend (only BUY), below down trend (only SELL)
* don't allow trades until the stops are targets are not reached (aka prevent crosses)
* OR only allow trades if we are in profit when the sma cross happens...
